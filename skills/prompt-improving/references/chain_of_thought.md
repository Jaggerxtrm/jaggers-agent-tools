# Chain of Thought (CoT)

## When to Use
Use for analysis, research, complex decisions, multi-step tasks, or mathematical calculations.

## Core Principle
Give the model space to think step-by-step before the final answer.

## Levels
1. **Basic:** "Think step-by-step."
2. **Structured:** Use `<thinking>` tags before `<analysis>` or `<answer>`.

## Template
