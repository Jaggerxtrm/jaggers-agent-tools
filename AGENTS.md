## Communication Style

Use controlled, precise, and direct language throughout the work session, including plans, progress updates, analysis, reviews, implementation notes, documentation, handoffs, and final reports. Prefer explicit subjects, active voice, consistent terminology, concrete statements, and logically ordered sentences. Keep the writing natural and concise. Avoid conversational filler, ornamental language, vague qualifiers, unnecessary jargon, and exaggerated certainty.

Adapt the level of rigor to the context. Use clear technical prose for analysis, architecture, debugging, design discussion, and collaboration. Use a stricter ASD-STE100-oriented style for procedures, commands, migrations, deployments, security requirements, destructive operations, rollback instructions, acceptance criteria, and operator handoffs. In these cases, state conditions before actions, identify the responsible actor, express one principal action per sentence, preserve the required sequence, and describe expected results and failure conditions explicitly.

Clearly distinguish verified facts, observations, assumptions, inferences, recommendations, and unresolved questions. Do not report an action as successful without evidence. Preserve exact names for repositories, services, contracts, routes, identifiers, configuration fields, and work items. Do not omit material ownership, dependencies, risks, preconditions, rollback requirements, or verification criteria for the sake of brevity.

## Task Tracking (two-tier)

Up to two task systems coexist in this repo. Where the runtime exposes both, use both; do not substitute one for the other. On a runtime with no task tools, beads alone is correct and complete — do not invent or call a native task API the runtime does not expose.

- **Beads (`bd`)** — top-level durable tracking, on every runtime. Authoritative for ownership, dependencies, cross-session memory, and closure. Read the rest of this file and use targeted lookup (`bd ready`, `bd show <id>`) before starting work. File, claim, and close work here.
- **The runtime's own task system, when the runtime has one** — this-session execution tracking. Use it to mirror the active bead and break it into smaller intermediate steps. Ephemeral; does not replace beads. Names differ per runtime; read the runtime's own tool list rather than assuming a name.

Rule: on a runtime that exposes task tools, when you pick up a bead, create native tasks that track it — reference the bead ID in each task title (e.g. `N.N summary — status (worker %NNNN)`) — and add any smaller intermediate steps as native sub-tasks. Beads own the durable record; native tasks own the in-flight breakdown.

Example native task list mirroring beads:
- ◼ N.N smoke container global surface — BLOCKS RELEASE (worker %NNNN)
- ◼ N.N status test flake under load (worker %NNNN)
- ◻ Pre-release smoke run against current main branches
- ◻ Dispatch N.N stale doc metrics + N.N Claude inbox surface
- ◻ Dispatch N.N, N.N, N.N remaining small beads

# XTRM Agent Workflow

> Full reference: `/using-xtrm` skill (or `XTRM-GUIDE.md` where present).
> This is a compact managed block. Use CLI `--help` and skills for details; do not paste full manuals here.
> Shared canonical contract (`.xtrm/config/instructions/agent-contract.md`); the sections between the contract markers are byte-identical in both tops. Only the trailing Runtime notes differ.

<!-- contract:start -->

## Canonical Sources
- CLI `--help` is canonical for syntax; skills own **when**. Managed blocks are routers, not manuals.
- Managed blocks and installed skills update via `xt update --apply`; check versions with `xt version --check-updates`.

## Session start (targeted — no bulk context dump)

1. Read repo identity + non-negotiables at the top of the root agent guide first.
2. Service/docs/project context: check `service-knowledge status` / `index stats` (rebuild when stale/absent), then `service-knowledge index query "<3-5 task terms>" --bundle`; read only the cited evidence. Skip repos without a service registry.
3. Executable work: targeted Beads lookup (`bd ready`, `bd list --status=in_progress`, `bd search "<terms>"`, `bd show <id>`), then `bd update <id> --claim` before edits. `bd memories <topic>` / `bd recall <key>` only when history is relevant.
4. Catch up: handoff/next-session beads, latest `xt report` handoffs, recent merged/closed PRs; `/issue-triage` if the board is unclear.
5. If the runtime supports local task planning, use it for non-trivial work, synchronized with the active bead.

## Operating rules

- Beads is authoritative for ownership, dependencies, memory gates, and closure; runtime-local task plans are ephemeral execution tracking.
- Memory gate at close: `bd remember` when useful, then `bd kv set memory-acked:<id> saved:<key>` or `nothing novel:<reason>`, then `bd close <id> --reason="..."`.
- Before editing existing symbols run GitNexus impact (`gitnexus_impact`) when available; before commit, run `gitnexus_detect_changes`.
- Ask before destructive, irreversible, production-impacting, or history-rewriting actions; skip repetitive "Proceed?" confirmations once scope is clear.
- Run targeted tests/build/typecheck for changed files; fix quality failures before commit.

## Skill routing (on demand)

- Full workflow + command surface: `/using-xtrm`; syntax per CLI: `bd --help`, `bv --robot-triage --format toon`, `xt --help`, `xtmux --help`, `sp --help`.
- Delegation: `/using-specialists`; multi-pane coordination: `/multiplexing`; service context: `/scope`, `/using-service-knowledge`.
- Planning/tests/board: `/planning`, `/test-planning`, `/issue-triage`; release/close: `/xt-end`, `/xt-merge`.

## Rule conflict — TaskCreate / TodoWrite

If a `bd prime` full-context run (opt-in diagnostic) reports *"Prohibited: Do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown files for task tracking"*, **this project overrides that line.** Runtime-local task planning coexists with beads — beads is the durable authority; local plans are ephemeral execution tracking. Do not create MEMORY.md files.

<!-- contract:end -->

## Runtime notes (Pi / runtime-neutral)

- Project skills catalog: Pi's native `<available_skills>` metadata; force-load a skill's body at turn 1 via `/skill:<name>`.
- Full workflow examples + prompt-shaping guidance: `/skill:using-xtrm` (on demand — no longer eager-injected on Pi).
- Use background process tooling for long-running servers, watchers, and log tails instead of shell backgrounding.
- Worktree launch: `xt pi` — launch Pi in a sandboxed worktree; `xt pi --role <specialist>` for an interactive specialist session (e.g. `chain-coordinator`, `pr-reviewer`, `sre-triage`). Coordination and escalation live in `/multiplexing` Pattern 7 and `/using-specialists`.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **core**. Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

## Specialists

MCP is intentionally minimal: only `use_specialist` is exposed. Use CLI for orchestration (`run/feed/result/steer/resume/stop`).
Legacy `start_specialist` is deprecated and should be migrated to `specialists run <name> --prompt "..." --background` ahead of next-major removal.

**Core specialist commands (CLI-first in pi):**
- `specialists list`
- `specialists run <name> --bead <id>`
- `specialists run <name> --prompt "..."`
- `specialists feed -f` / `specialists feed <job-id>`
- `specialists result <job-id>`
- `specialists resume <job-id> "next task"` (for keep-alive jobs in `waiting`)
- `specialists stop <job-id>`

**Running specialists in background (recommended): use the process extension**
- Tool actions: `process start`, `list`, `output`, `logs`, `kill`, `clear`
- Example: `process start "specialists run explorer --bead unitAI-123" name="sp-explorer"`
- Useful commands: `/ps`, `/ps:pin`, `/ps:logs`, `/ps:kill`, `/ps:clear`, `/ps:dock`, `/ps:settings`
- Benefits: unified log dock, follow mode, focus mode, file-based logs, friendly names, auto-cleanup

**Canonical tracked flow**
1. Create/claim bead issue
2. Run specialist with `--bead <id>` (for long work, launch via `process start`)
3. Observe progress (`process output`/`process logs` or `specialists feed`)
4. Read final output (`specialists result <job-id>`)
5. Close/update bead with outcome

Add custom specialists to `.specialists/user/` to extend defaults.
