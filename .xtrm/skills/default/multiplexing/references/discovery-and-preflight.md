# Discovery and pre-flight

### From Pi

For Pi peers:

```typescript
intercom({ action: "list" })
```

For Claude peers:

```typescript
claude-link({ action: "list" })
```

Verify target name/id and cwd before a consequential handoff.

### From Claude Code

Use `ListAgents` or `/list-agents` to see addressable peers. A Pi session running `pi-claude-link` should appear in the same peer list.

Verify the target name and working directory. If native discovery says the target is absent, do not guess a tmux pane and inject the message anyway.

### tmux inventory

Use plain tmux only when you need terminal topology or to account for non-agent panes:

```bash
tmux list-sessions
tmux list-panes -a -F '#{session_name} #{window_id} #{pane_id} #{pane_current_command} #{pane_current_path}'
```

A pane being present does not prove its agent transport is reachable; the native roster decides that.

## Before starting

Do not start by running `xtmux --help`.

1. If launching a new worker, run `xt --help` and the relevant `xt <provider> --help`. The current CLI is authoritative for launch flags.
2. Verify the current harness/runtime version when transport behavior is in doubt (`pi --version`, `claude --version`).
3. For Pi, verify the required extensions are loaded (`pi list` or the current Pi package/config surface):
   - `pi-intercom`
   - `pi-claude-link`
4. For Claude Code, verify `/list-agents` is available. If it is not, native cross-session messaging is unavailable in that session.
5. Never install or globally reconfigure a dependency silently. Missing native transport is a visible prerequisite/failure, not permission to fall back invisibly.

Test setup, if the operator chooses to install the messaging dependencies:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-intercom
pi install git:github.com/alonw0/pi-claude-link
```

Do not install `pi-messenger` or `pi-collaborating-agents` merely for this skill; they carry broader task/spawn/reservation semantics that native coordination does not need.
